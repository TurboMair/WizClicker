# WizClicker
 An autoclicker for Wiz101

 This program is used to farm battles. I would suggest building a deck with 3 copies of an AOE and (if you aren't death) a healing spell like Pixie or Unicorn (Something that doesn't require further selection after clicked)
 
 This program is not smart!! It only runs inputs on a loop. However, that means this program is very lightweight and requires no setup (besides the deck)

 It will attempt to:
 *  Walk backwards, forward slightly less than the length of a battle circle, and then backwards again
 *  Click the card in the center of the screen
 *  Click pass (To prevent desyncing issues causing no spells to be cast when using the program with others, you will notice it only clicks pass every other loop)
 *  Type the next line of the script into the chat (Optional function)

# Installation instructions
 1. Select the releases tab for this github repository and download the .exe
 2. Run it!
 That's all it needs, no admin rights or set up. The program will have further instructions inside.

 (As signing code is an expensive and official process, Windows may detect the code as unsafe and require you to allow the code to run. The code was not built to be malicious, but I have noticed it can accidentally open windows and search things when attempting to type.)
 
 (Please do not use files as text scripts if you do not trust its contents and only press the button to start the program when you are ready for it to begin input. Also, let the program finish inputting after pressing the pause and stop buttons.)
